# Chapter 1

This chapter breifly introduces why we "must" use OOP pattern, and the basic structure of well-OOPed-program.

## Common feature
1. There are four kinds of animals: Dog, Cat, Elephant, and something else.
2. Animals can bark and eat.
3. We will generate new animal via `GetRandomAnimal()` function, and call `Bark()` and `Eat()` function to check which animal is generated.
