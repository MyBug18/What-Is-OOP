# What is OOP?

This repository is designed to help programming newbies who are struggling to catch the concept about object oriented programming.

The main target of this *some kind of* lecture is:
* I don't know what is OOP.
* I've heard about OOP, but I don't know why we should use it.
* I fully understand the reason and benefits of using OOP, but I don't know how to make best of it.

The lecture is using C#, but I want to say that the concept of OOP must not be bound to the specific language.

Every example is a one complete C# project, so opening cmd and `dotnet run` will do. (Given installed proper .NET version)
